# Session retrospectives

Append one bullet at the close of every Wharf implementation session. Record
what was surprising and what should be done differently in the next session.

- Session 1 (`0.1.0`): Cobra's automatic version flag unexpectedly allowed
  trailing unknown input to succeed, and parsing lower-precedence environment
  values before changed flags weakened the precedence contract. Next session,
  test invalid lower-precedence values and mixed global-flag/argument cases as
  soon as each configuration layer is introduced.
- Release close (`0.1.0`): The independent code review caught integration
  defects that package-level tests missed, especially logger wiring and Cobra
  help error propagation. Keep compiled CLI boundary probes in every release
  proof, not only unit and race tests.
- Migration restart (`0.1.0` withdrawn): Replacing the short-lived Go
  implementation before the first supported release avoids maintaining two
  languages. Keep the .NET process boundary and compiled CLI probes as the
  first proof of the restarted release.
- Session 2 (`0.2.0`): A standalone task prompt produced a clearer enterprise
  boundary than directing the agent through the repository session workflow.
  Keep future test prompts self-contained, while retaining implementation
  evidence separately in `.github/tracking/`.
- Session 3 (`0.3.0`): Custom identifier structs initially compiled but did
  not round-trip through JSON deserialization, which surfaced only when replay
  materialized a summary. Add serialization round-trip tests immediately when
  introducing durable contracts, and prefer explicit converters over relying on
  constructor inference.
- Session 4 (`0.4.0`): Harbor task manifests vary in whether the task-level
  description is populated, while metadata consistently carries the display
  description. Preserve the source shape but use the metadata description as
  the explicit fallback, and keep reference material out of vendored fixtures.
- Session 5 (`0.5.0`): A real host probe exposed that a machine can have a
  healthy Docker daemon while still failing workload capacity, such as a low
  inotify limit. The first implementation also conflated inotify instances
  and watches; validate related kernel settings independently and keep
  platform, daemon, and capacity outcomes separate so an unsupported-host
  override cannot hide a safety failure.
