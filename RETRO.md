# Session retrospectives

Append one bullet at the close of every Wharf implementation session. Record
what was surprising and what should be done differently in the next session.

- Session 1 (`0.1.0`): Cobra's automatic version flag unexpectedly allowed
  trailing unknown input to succeed, and parsing lower-precedence environment
  values before changed flags weakened the precedence contract. Next session,
  test invalid lower-precedence values and mixed global-flag/argument cases as
  soon as each configuration layer is introduced.
- Release close (`0.1.0`): The independent code review caught integration
  defects that package-level tests missed, especially logger wiring and Cobra
  help error propagation. Keep compiled CLI boundary probes in every release
  proof, not only unit and race tests.
- Migration restart (`0.1.0` withdrawn): Replacing the short-lived Go
  implementation before the first supported release avoids maintaining two
  languages. Keep the .NET process boundary and compiled CLI probes as the
  first proof of the restarted release.
